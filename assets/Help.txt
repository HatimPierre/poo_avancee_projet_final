	I - Keyboard shortcuts

  	 To simplify repetitive task and improve workflow, shortcuts have been
implemented in this software. Please notice that this list
is subject to evolutions.

	CTRL-E      Allows you to Export an image with popular file formats
	CTRL-H      Displays this manual
	CTRL-I      Allows you to import an image into the current project
	CTRL-N      Open a new default project named "Default"
	CTRL-S      Saves the current project in it's former location if applicable
	CTRL-R      Allows you to rename the project
	CTRL-O      Allows you to access the software's options
	CTRL-W      Closes the current project
	CTRL-ALT-R  Allows you to resize the image held by the current panel
	ALT-R       Redos previous actions until there is no more to process
	ALT-U       Undos previous actions until there is no more to process
	ALT-O       Allows you to open an already existing project
	ESCAPE      Exits the program as if close button has been pressed



	II - General use

In this image processing software, you might use the following features:

		(i) Filters: Filters are algorithm that you can apply to an
image to modify it's look. Some of them are parametrized (when relevant)
and most of them take advantage of multithreading to decrease processing cost
and improve time-efficiency

		(ii) Tools: A set of tools is left at your disposal 
to either resize or paint over the image to make it more suitable to your needs.
This could be upgraded with the next versions of the software to give you
more control over your work.

		(iii) Miscellaneous:
			a - Job size: You can set this value in the Option panel.
It is used to determine a job's size during multithreading processing of a 
filer computation. A job is a set of pixel of width and height equal to "size".
Each job is submitted to a thread so that the image wil be faster computed taking
advantage of all system resources.
